excerpt: >-
  The integer sequence 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... is well known as the
  Fibonacci sequence. It is easily defined by F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1 and F_n = F_{n-1}
  + F_{n-2} for n >= 2. To compute F_n you could use this definition directly,
  but that leads to a highly inefficient algorithm that is both recursive and
  which uses a number of additions which grows exponentially with n.

The integer [sequence](http://oeis.org/A000045) 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, &#8230; is well known as the [Fibonacci](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci) sequence. It is easily defined by $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for $n \geq 2$.

To compute $F_n$ you could use this definition directly, but that leads to a *highly inefficient* algorithm that is both recursive and which uses a number of additions which grows exponentially with $n$.

The first observation that leads to a better algorithm is that we can iteratively compute $F_2, F_3, \ldots, F_n$ and at each step, we only need the previous two values from the sequence. So if we set

$$
T(a,b) = (a+b, a)
$$

and $r(a,b)=b$ then we have $F_n = r(T^n(1,0))$, where $T^n$ means that the operator $T$ is applied $n$ times (and $T^0$ is the identity). This reduces the number of iterations to $n$ which is much much better than exponential growth.

But it can get even better. The following method is inspired by [Exercise 1.19](https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs/1.2.4#ex-1.19) in the book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](/refs/sicp). The key observation is that if we introduce

$$
T_{p,q}(a,b) = (a q + a p + b q, b p + a q)
$$

then we have both $T(a,b)=T_{0,1}(a,b)$ and

$$
T_{p,q}^2(a,b) = T_{p,q}(a q + a p + b q, b p + a q) = \ldots = T_{p^2+q^2,2 p q+q^2}(a,b).
$$

Why is this important? Because now we have

1. $T_{p,q}^0(a,b) = (a,b)$
2. $T_{p,q}^{2k}(a,b) = (T_{p,q}^2)^k(a,b) = T_{p^2+q^2,2 p q+q^2}^k(a,b)$
3. $T_{p,q}^{2k+1}(a,b) = T_{p,q}^{2k}(T_{p,q}(a,b)) = T_{p,q}^{2k}(a q + a p + b q, b p + a q)$

Notice how this type of reduction rules are very similar to those found in the [Evaluation of Powers post](/blog/2011/01/evaluation-of-powers). Let us look at an example and try to evaluate $F_{20} = r(T^{20}(1,0)) = r(T_{0,1}^{20}(1,0))$ using these rules:

$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{0,1}^{20}(1,0) &= (T_{0,1}^2)^{10}(1,0) = T_{1,1}^{10}(1,0) = (T_{1,1}^2)^5(1,0) = T_{2,3}^5(1,0) \\
&= T_{2,3}^4(T_{2,3}(1,0)) = T_{2,3}^4(5,3) = (T_{2,3}^2)^2(5,3) = T_{13,21}^2(5,3) \\
&= T_{610,987}(5,3) = (10946,6765)
\end{aligned}
$$

Then we just have to extract the second component (as done by applying the $r$ function) and we get $F_{20}=6765$.

It is clear that the number and type of steps depend on the binary representation of $n$ when computing $F_n$ using this method. Actually, reduction rule 2 will be performed $\lfloor\log_2(n)\rfloor$ times and the number of times reduction rule 3 is performed corresponds to the number of 1s in the binary representation of $n$. So the total number of steps needed for evaluating $F_n$ using this method is logarithmic in $n$.

Let us look at a `C++` implementation. A straightforward implementation is this:

``` cpp
fibtype fib_rec(fibtype a, fibtype b, fibtype p, fibtype q, unsigned count) {
  if (count == 0)
    return b;
  if (count % 2 == 0)
    return fib_rec(a, b, p*p+q*q, 2*p*q+q*q, count/2);
  return fib_rec(b*q+a*q+a*p, b*p+a*q, p, q, count-1);
}
```

where $F_n$ = `fib_rec(1, 0, 0, 1, n)` (`fibtype` is just a `typedef` for an appropriate integer type.) It can be made iterative and improved at bit in the following way:

``` cpp
fibtype fibonacci(unsigned n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  fibtype a=1, b=0, p=0, q=1, tmp;
  while (n != 1) {
    if (n % 2 != 0) {
        tmp = b*q + a*q + a*p;
        b   = b*p + a*q;
        a   = tmp;
    }
    tmp = p*p + q*q;
    q   = (2*p + q)*q;
    p   = tmp;
    n /= 2;
  }
  return b*p + a*q;
}
```

The most important improvement here is probably the observation that $r(T_{p,q}(a,b)) = b p + a q$.

I don't claim that this is the fastest possible method for evaluating (single) Fibonacci numbers, but it certainly beats the "traditional" methods mentioned in the beginning (it may be inferior for small $n$, though). Note also that as long as the numbers fit into the registers of the computer, the time necessary to perform each step is bounded by a constant. If multiple-precision is needed, however, this may no longer the case.

Please inform me of other fast ways to compute Fibonacci numbers.
