[Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/) is a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites (in their own words). There are [a lot of them](http://stackexchange.com/sites) and [more are coming](http://area51.stackexchange.com/). The most relevant of them, in relation to this blog, are probably [MathOverflow](http://mathoverflow.net/), [Mathematics](http://math.stackexchange.com/), [Theoretical Computer Science](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/), and [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).

I recently looked through those sites for interesting questions tagged *big-list*. These questions typically encourage many different answers. I recommend the following:

*   [A single math paper everyone should read](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/2144/a-single-paper-everyone-should-read)
*   [Examples of common false beliefs in mathematics](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/23478/examples-of-common-false-beliefs-in-mathematics)
*   [Math puzzles for dinner](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/29323/math-puzzles-for-dinner)
*   [Math proofs without words](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/8846/proofs-without-words)
*   [Colorful language in serious math papers](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/22299/what-are-some-examples-of-colorful-language-in-serious-mathematics-papers)
*   [Counter-intuitive theorems that can be translated into everyday language](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/250/a-challenge-by-r-p-feynman-give-counter-intuitive-theorems-that-can-be-transl)
*   [Computer science books everyone ](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/3253/what-books-should-everyone-read)[should read](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/3253/what-books-should-everyone-read)
*   [Recent computer science books with online drafts available](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/3540/what-are-the-recent-tcs-books-whose-drafts-are-available-online/)
*   [Computer science papers everyone should read](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1168/what-papers-should-everyone-read)
*   [Lecture notes in computer science everyone should read](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/4074/what-lecture-notes-should-everyone-read/)
*   [Videos on computer science everyone ](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1198/what-videos-should-everybody-watch)[should watch](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1198/what-videos-should-everybody-watch)
*   [Algorithms from &#8220;The Book&#8221;](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/189/algorithms-from-the-book)
