How do you calculate the point where two lines in the plane intersect? It is not very hard to do, but the formula can look [quite complicated](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Line-line_intersection&oldid=330824670), depending on how you write it up. This article is a reminder that it can be expressed in a simple manner.

We start out by not restricting ourselves to the plane, but any [vector space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) with an [inner product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product) $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$. Let two lines be represented as

<div class="pull-right">(1)</div>

$$
\text{p} + s \text{v}, \quad s \in \mathbb{R}
$$

and

$$
\text{q} + t \text{w}, \quad t \in \mathbb{R}
$$

where $\text{p}$, $\text{q}$, $\text{v}$, and $\text{w}$ are vectors. We assume that both $\text{v}$ and $\text{w}$ are non-null. See Figure&nbsp;1.

We look for values of $s$ and $t$ such that

<div class="pull-right">(2)</div>

$$
\text{p} + s \text{v} = \text{q} + t \text{w}.
$$

Let $\hat{\text{w}} \neq 0$ be a vector perpendicular to $\text{w}$, $\langle \text{w}, \hat{\text{w}} \rangle = 0$. We get

<div class="pull-right">(3)</div>

$$
s \langle \text{v}, \hat{\text{w}} \rangle = \langle \text{q} - \text{p}, \hat{\text{w}} \rangle
$$

Now if $\langle \text{v}, \hat{\text{w}} \rangle = 0$ there are two possibilities: If $\langle \text{q} - \text{p}, \hat{\text{w}} \rangle = 0$ there are infinitely many solutions, i.e., the lines overlap, but if $\langle \text{q} - \text{p}, \hat{\text{w}} \rangle \neq 0$ there are no solutions, i.e., the lines are parallel and do not intersect.

Assume then $\langle \text{v}, \hat{\text{w}} \rangle \neq 0$. We get

$$
s = \frac{\langle \text{q} - \text{p}, \hat{\text{w}} \rangle}{\langle \text{v}, \hat{\text{w}} \rangle},
$$

and thus, after inserting into&nbsp;(1), the point of intersection is

$$
\text{p} + \frac{\langle \text{q} - \text{p}, \hat{\text{w}} \rangle}{\langle \text{v}, \hat{\text{w}} \rangle} \text{v}.
$$

### The Plane is Special

The derivation above is actually a little careless. If&nbsp;(2) is to hold for some $s$ and $t$, then&nbsp;(3) must also hold. Turning the implication the other way, which we would like to, is less straightforward.

Assume that&nbsp;(3) holds for some value of&nbsp;$s$,

<div class="pull-right">(4)</div>

$$
\langle s \text{v} + \text{p} - \text{q}, \hat{\text{w}} \rangle = 0.
$$

What does this mean? It means that the vectors $s \text{v} + \text{p} - \text{q}$ and $\hat{\text{w}}$ are perpendicular to each other, and if we are in two dimensions/the plane we must have $s \text{v} + \text{p} - \text{q} = t \text{w}$ for some value of $t$. This is&nbsp;(2) and we are done.

Does this work in higher dimensions? Generally, no. Consider, e.g., three dimensions and Equation&nbsp;(4). What can we derive of it now? We have that

$$
s \text{v} + \text{p} - \text{q} = \alpha \text{w}_1 + \beta \text{w}_2
$$

for some values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and where $\langle \text{w}_1, \hat{\text{w}} \rangle = \langle \text{w}_2, \hat{\text{w}} \rangle = 0$. And $\alpha \text{w}_1 + \beta \text{w}_2 = t \text{w}$ does not necessarily hold for any $t$, so&nbsp;(2) does generally not follow in three dimensions or more.

### Summary Using Coordinates

Let us consider the usual [two-dimensional Euclidean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry) [space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space) and [Cartesian coordinates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system). We set

$$
\text{p} = (p_1,p_2), \quad \text{q} = (q_1,q_2), \quad \text{v} = (v_1,v_2), \quad \text{w} = (w_1,w_2),
$$

and use the inner product

$$
\langle (a_1,a_2), (b_1,b_2) \rangle = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2.
$$

Rotating a vector $\text{w} = (w_1,w_2)$ counterclockwise by a right angle is easily done with $\hat{\text{w}} = (-w_2, w_1)$. It is easily checked that $\langle \text{w}, \hat{\text{w}} \rangle = 0$.

Recall that we are interested in knowing whether the two lines

$$
(x,y) = (p_1,p_2) + s (v_1,v_2), \quad s \in \mathbb{R}
$$

and

$$
(x,y) = (q_1,q_2) + t (w_1,w_2), \quad t \in \mathbb{R}
$$

intersect.

Setting $\alpha = w_1 v_2 - w_2 v_1$ and $\beta = w_1 (q_2-p_2) - w_2 (q_1-p_1)$, we have

*   $\alpha = 0$, $\beta = 0$: The two lines overlap.
*   $\alpha = 0$, $\beta \neq 0$: The lines are parallel but do not intersect.
*   $\alpha \neq 0$: The lines meet at a single point, $(p_1 + \frac{\beta}{\alpha} v_1, p_2 + \frac{\beta}{\alpha} v_2)$.
