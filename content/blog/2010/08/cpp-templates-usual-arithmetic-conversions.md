If you add a `short int` and a `char` in C++, what is the resulting type? What if you subtract a `long int` from an `unsigned int`? The answers actually depend on the compiler and the target architecture (`int` or `unsigned` in the first case and `long int` or `unsigned long int` in the second). This article lists the rules from the current C++ standard and gives an example of how the type can be resolved at compile time using templates.

### Introduction

Let me first note that I will be referring to the current C++ standard from 1998 (with a minor revision in 2003). This standard is described in <a href="/refs/stroustrup">The C++ Programming Language</a> by [Bjarne Stroustrup](http://www.stroustrup.com). ~~It can also be found online.~~

In C++, the *integer types* are `short int`, `int`, `long int` and the unsigned versions of these. The integer types together with the boolean type (`bool`) and the character types (plain/`signed`/`unsigned` `char` and `wchar_t`) are called *integral types*. The integral types together with the floating-point types (`float`, `double`, and `long double`) are called *arithmetic types*.

### Resolving the Return Type

Consider having the function `fct` overloaded with one function for each arithmetic type, for example:

``` cpp
void fct(short v)          { std::cout << "short "          << v << std::endl; }
void fct(unsigned short v) { std::cout << "unsigned short " << v << std::endl; }
void fct(int v)            { std::cout << "int "            << v << std::endl; }
void fct(unsigned v)       { std::cout << "unsigned "       << v << std::endl; }
...
```

and so on. If you now have the following little routine:

``` cpp
void g(short int a, char b) {
  fct(a + b);
}
```

which instance of `fct` is called? This is another way of asking the question that started this article.

When a binary operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) is applied to operands with arithmetic types, the C++ compiler must do the following:

*   **Integral promotion**. Each operand is, if necessary, promoted to at least an `int` (to be made more precise below).
*   **Usual arithmetic conversions**. Based on the (possibly promoted) types of the operands, a common type is found. Both operands are converted to this type, which will also be the resulting type.

### Integral Promotions

Integral promotions are defined in Section 4.5, page 4-3, from the ~~online~~ standard and in Section C.6.1, page 833, from <a href="/refs/stroustrup">The C++ Programming Language</a>. If we ignore enumerations and bit-fields, they can be summed up as follows:

*   A `char`, `signed char`, `signed char`, `short int`, `unsigned short int` is converted to `int` if `int` can represent all the values of the source type; otherwise, it is converted to an `unsigned int`.
*   `wchar_t` is converted to the first of the following types that can represent all the values of `wchar_t`: `int`, `unsigned int`, `long`, `unsigned long`.
*   `bool` is converted to `int`.

### Usual Arithmetic Conversions

The rules for usual arithmetic conversions can be found in Section 5, page 5-2, from the ~~online~~ standard and in Section C.6.3, page 836, from <a href="/refs/stroustrup">The C++ Programming Language</a>. Assuming integral promotions have been performed (if needed), the usual arithmetic conversions are in essense the following:

*   If one operand is a `long int` and the other `unsigned int`, then if a `long int` can represent all the values of an `unsigned int`, the `unsigned int` shall be converted to a `long int`; otherwise both operands shall be converted to `unsigned long int`.
*   Otherwise, find the highest ranking type among the operands and convert the other operand to this type. The relevant types listed from high to low rank are: `long double`, `double`, `float`, `unsigned long`, `long`, `unsigned`, `int`.

### Using Templates To Get The Type

Those were the rules in written form. Imagine now that we have, e.g., the following routine:

``` cpp
template <typename A, typename B>
[some-type] add(const A& a, const B& b) { return a + b; }
```

We would like the types of `add(a, b)` and `a + b` to be identical when both `a` and `b` are arithmetic types.

First, promotions. By default, a type is not promoted:

``` cpp
template <typename T>
struct promote { typedef T type; };
```

We then use template specializations for the types that need to be promoted. Some of these are easy:

``` cpp
template <>
struct promote<signed short> { typedef int type; };
template <>
struct promote<bool> { typedef int type; };
```

For the rest, we need a sort of if-then-else for choosing a type:

``` cpp
template <bool C, typename T, typename F>
struct choose_type { typedef F type; };
template <typename T, typename F>
struct choose_type<true, T, F> { typedef T type; };
```

So the boolean value of the first argument determines whether to choose the type `T` (if true) or `F` (if false). We now have:

``` cpp
template <>
struct promote<unsigned short> {
  typedef choose_type<sizeof(short) < sizeof(int), int, unsigned>::type type;
};
template <>
struct promote<signed char> {
  typedef choose_type<sizeof(char) <= sizeof(int), int, unsigned>::type type;
};
template <>
struct promote<unsigned char> {
  typedef choose_type<sizeof(char) < sizeof(int), int, unsigned>::type type;
};
template <>
struct promote<char>
 : public promote<choose_type<std::numeric_limits<char>::is_signed,
                              signed char, unsigned char>::type> {};
```

This last one for plain `char` is needed because C++ considers `char`, `signed char`, and `unsigned char` to be three distinct types. The standard does not specify whether `char` is signed or not. (The `numeric_limits` template is defined in the `limits` header.)

Finally, to promote `wchar_t`:

``` cpp
template <>
struct promote<wchar_t> {
  typedef choose_type<
            std::numeric_limits<wchar_t>::is_signed,
            choose_type<sizeof(wchar_t) <= sizeof(int), int, long>::type,
            choose_type<sizeof(wchar_t) <= sizeof(int), unsigned, unsigned long>::type
          >::type type;
};
```

We can now turn to the usual arithmetic conversions. First, we promote each type, if necessary:

``` cpp
template <typename A, typename B>
struct resolve_uac : public resolve_uac2<typename promote<A>::type,
                                         typename promote<B>::type> {};
```

This ensures that the type arguments for `resolve_uac2` are at least `int`s. We then introduce ranks for those types:

``` cpp
template <typename T> struct type_rank;
template <> struct type_rank<int>           { static const int rank = 1; };
template <> struct type_rank<unsigned>      { static const int rank = 2; };
template <> struct type_rank<long>          { static const int rank = 3; };
template <> struct type_rank<unsigned long> { static const int rank = 4; };
template <> struct type_rank<float>         { static const int rank = 5; };
template <> struct type_rank<double>        { static const int rank = 6; };
template <> struct type_rank<long double>   { static const int rank = 7; };
```

Now we can pick the type with the highest rank:

``` cpp
template <typename A, typename B>
struct resolve_uac2 {
  typedef typename choose_type<
            type_rank<A>::rank >= type_rank<B>::rank, A, B
          >::type return_type;
};
```

Finally we need to deal with the special case where one type is `long int` and the other is `unsigned int`:

``` cpp
template <>
struct resolve_uac2<long, unsigned> {
  typedef choose_type<sizeof(long) == sizeof(unsigned),
                      unsigned long, long>::type return_type;
};
template <>
struct resolve_uac2<unsigned, long> : public resolve_uac2<long, unsigned> {};
```

We can now write the `add` routine from earlier as:

``` cpp
template <typename A, typename B>
typename resolve_uac<A, B>::return_type add(const A& a, const B& b)
{ return a + b; }
```

and the return type will match that of the `+` operation. Note that the arguments to `add` have to be arithmetic types (because of the [substitution-failure-is-not-an-error](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_failure_is_not_an_error) principle).

### Remarks

The rules and implementation above should be complete with the exception of enumerations and bit-fields, see the links to the standard for the missing pieces. Note also that the rules for promotions and usual arithmetic conversions will change (slightly) in the upcoming C++0x standard, see the [C++0x draft](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3092.pdf), Section 5, page 84.
