Presents the MapReduce programming model. Developed at Google, this model simplifies the process of executing large-scale data processing jobs on distributed clusters by dividing tasks into 'Map' (data processing) and 'Reduce' (data aggregation) functions. This framework automates the complexities of parallelization, fault tolerance, and load balancing, significantly impacting the design and implementation of big data technologies.
