Introduces the QuickSort algorithm, a highly efficient sorting technique based on the divide-and-conquer strategy. It describes how to sort an array by partitioning it into two sub-arrays, each containing elements less than or greater than a selected pivot, respectively, and then recursively applying the same process to each sub-array. The simplicity, efficiency, and average-case performance of QuickSort, with a time complexity of
O(n log n), have made it one of the most widely used sorting algorithms in computer science.
