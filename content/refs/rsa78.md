Introduces the RSA algorithm, a groundbreaking public-key cryptographic system. The RSA algorithm enables secure data encryption and digital signatures, which are essential for secure communications over the Internet. The method involves generating two large prime numbers and deriving public and private keys from these numbers that can encrypt and decrypt data. This innovation has become one of the pillars of secure digital communications, allowing for private transactions and data integrity verification in a wide range of applications.
