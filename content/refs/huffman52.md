Introduces the Huffman coding algorithm, which generates optimal prefix codes for a set of symbols based on their frequencies of occurrence. The key concept is to assign shorter codes to more frequent symbols and longer codes to less frequent ones, minimizing the average code length needed to encode data. Huffman coding is used widely in data compression due to its efficiency and simplicity. The algorithm is fundamental in applications like file compression formats and communication protocols, where minimizing data size is crucial.
