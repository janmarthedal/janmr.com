Introduces an efficient method for drawing straight lines on digital plotters. It avoids complex arithmetic by using incremental error terms to determine the closest pixels along a line, significantly enhancing line rendering on low-resolution devices. This algorithm has become a foundational technique in computer graphics for its simplicity and effectiveness.
