The Thue-Morse sequence is a binary sequence that is constructed by starting with the digit 0 and then repeatedly appending the binary complement of the sequence so far. Using two simple turtle graphics rules (0: forward one, 1: turn 60°), the sequence produces a Koch curve. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue%E2%80%93Morse_sequence#Fractals_and_turtle_graphics https://oeis.org/A010060
