The M/o/Vfuscator compiles programs into "mov" instructions, and only "mov" instructions. Arithmetic, comparisons, jumps, function calls, and everything else a program needs are all performed through mov operations; there is no self-modifying code, no transport-triggered calculation, and no other form of non-mov cheating. 🤯 https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator
