As a final remark, note that for any real number $x$ we have

$$
-s(e^{-x}) = -\frac{\ln(e^{-x})}{e^{-x}} = x e^x,
$$

and the inverse function (branches) of $x \mapsto x e^x$
is commonly called the
[Lambert W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_W_function)
[function](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LambertW-Function.html)
and it has undergone a lot of study.
