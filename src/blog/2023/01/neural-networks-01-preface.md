  Kicking off a new blog series on Neural Networks
---
Neural Networks, or more correctly Artificial Neural Networks, have turned out to be
a very versatile tool in the world of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and
Data Science. They were originally inspired by biological neural networks (animal brains),
but have shown to be powerful in their own right.

[Many](https://www.tensorflow.org)
[frameworks](https://pytorch.org)
[exist](https://scikit-learn.org)
that with relative ease allow users to create complex models
within a diverse field of applications.

This blog series will go back and look at the fundamentals of neural networks.
In essense, a neural network is simply a mathematical function and we will look at them as such.
We will, from first principles, build the theory of neural networks.
We will then look at how to turn the theory into code
(using [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) for efficient numerical linear algebra).
